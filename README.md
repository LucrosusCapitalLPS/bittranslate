# BitTranslate
BitTranslate is a Subnet that rewards high-quality translations. Validators produce unique text using a multilingual text generation model. 
The text is then sent to Miners which apply a text-to-text model to produce a translation. 
The validator then evaluates the outputted translations using two Reward Models that are based on the methods from academic papers.

The subnet has been designed to be able to accommodate numerous translation pairs. 
The initial subnet supports pairs of languages including English, German, Spanish, Italian, and Polish.
We have plans to soon support many other languages.

## Installation

git clone https://github.com/LucrosusCapital/bittranslate.git
cd bittranslate
pip install -e . 
```

Bittensor must be installed separately.  

```bash
pip install bittensor
```
## Technical Overview

### Reward Models
#### BertScore
Based on the paper [BERTSCORE: EVALUATING TEXT GENERATION WITH BERT](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1904.09675.pdf) that uses [BertScore](https://github.com/Tiiiger/bert_score) to evaluate translated text.

#### VectorSim
Inspired by the STransQuest technique from [TransQuest: Translation Quality Estimation with  Cross-lingual Transformers](https://aclanthology.org/2020.coling-main.445.pdf). But, instead of using XLM-RoBERTa we used [Sentence Transformers](https://github.com/UKPLab/sentence-transformers) to compute the similarity of the source and translated texts.

### Datasets 
Validators use text from following datasets as a prompt for a text generation model that produces text which is then sent to miners.

| ngrok_domain | None | If set, expose the API over ngrok to the specified domain |
## Optional: Validator API
Validators have the can enable a REST API to allow them to produce translates for arbitrary text.  
The API can be enabled by supplying the "--enable_api" parameter. 

### Request Format
```python
import requests
response = requests.post(
        f'http://127.0.0.1:{9999}/translate', # provide the port number you supplied to  "--axon.port"
        headers={"auth": "change-me"}, # place the API key where "change-me" is. 
        json={
            "source_texts": ["hello world"], # you may provide a list of texts. Do not exceed 512 characters per source text or include more than 2 source texts. 
            "source_lang": "en", # Language code for the source text. 
            "target_lang":  "pl" # Language code for the translated text. 
        }
    )
print(response.json()) 
# {'detail': 'success', 'translated_texts': ['Witaj Åšwiat']}
```

### Config

The validator.py's "--api_json" parameter is for a path to a JSON config that defines API keys along with their rate limits. 
By default, a config file will be loaded from "neurons/api.json" will be loaded. Change the API key ID to a long UUID within this the file before deploying.  
This file can be edited as the validator is running without requiring a restart. 

```json
{
  "keys": {"3f1f582c-a735-4326-8cea-b9f70fda9d78": {"requests_per_min":  4},
          "c0b0c1cd-47df-4c62-8d03-bf7d279daa48": {"requests_per_min":  2}}
}
```
### Scoring 
By default, the responses from miners for API requests are not used to update the scores for the models. This can be enabled by passing the "--score_api" parameter.

### Security 
The API is hosted over HTTP, which is not secure.
To expose the API over a secure (HTTPS) endpoint,
sign up for a premium "ngrok" account and run the `ngrok config add-authtoken ...`
command from the [your-authtoken](https://dashboard.ngrok.com/get-started/your-authtoken) page.
Then, create a domain from the [domains](page).
We recommend using an "ngrok.app" domain rather than an "ngrok-free.app" domain,
as the later is blocked by some internet providers.

With the setup complete, launch the validator with the NGROK_DOMAIN environment variable, 
as well as 
```sh
python neurons/validator.py <other-args-such-as-wallet> --enable_api --ngrok_domain fluffy-blue.ngrok.app
```

If you instead want to use some other kind of reverse-proxy service, run it in a separate process.

### Debugging 
We recommend using the parameter "--no_artificial_eval" when debugging the API. 
This will disable artificial responses from being generated and sent to miners. 
Thus, simplifying the output logs of the validator. Don't forget to relaunch your validator without the "--no_artificial_eval" as soon as you're done testing. 

You can ping the API with "scripts/ping_api.py". Please refer to its get_config() method to learn about its CLI parameters.
